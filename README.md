Weather App E2145148
README
Overview
This Android application displays the current weather information based on the user's location. The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the temperature, humidity, and weather description. Additionally, it shows the current system time and address based on the provided coordinates. The app also changes the background based on the weather description (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy).
Features
•	Display current latitude and longitude.
•	Fetch and display the address corresponding to the provided coordinates.
•	Fetch and display current weather information including temperature, humidity, and weather description.
•	Dynamically update the background based on the weather description.
•	Show the current system time, updating every second.
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/weather-app.git
cd weather-app
1.	Open the Project in Android Studio
o	Launch Android Studio.
o	Select "Open an existing Android Studio project."
o	Navigate to the cloned repository directory and open it.
2.	Add Your API Key
o	The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. You need to provide your own API key.
o	Open MainActivity.java.
o	Replace the placeholder API key with your actual API key.


java
Copy code
private static final String API_KEY = "double latitude = 7.088466850302816;
double longitude = 80.03861842537052;
";
3.	Build and Run the Project
o	Connect your Android device or start an emulator.
o	Click on the "Run" button in Android Studio to build and run the app.
Project Structure
•	MainActivity.java: The main activity of the app. Handles fetching and displaying weather data, address, and system time.
•	activity_main.xml: The layout file for the main activity. Defines the UI components such as TextViews and RelativeLayout.
•	strings.xml: Contains string resources used in the app.
•	colors.xml: Defines color resources used in the app.
•	drawable/: Contains background images for different weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy).
Dependencies
The project uses the following dependencies:
•	Volley for network requests.
•	Geocoder for reverse geocoding to get the address.
Ensure you have the following dependencies added in your build.gradle file:
gradle
Copy code
dependencies {
    implementation(libs.appcompat)
    implementation(libs.material)
    implementation(libs.activity)
    implementation(libs.constraintlayout)
    testImplementation(libs.junit)
    androidTestImplementation(libs.ext.junit)
    androidTestImplementation(libs.espresso.core)

    // Adding necessary dependencies for weather application
    implementation(libs.volley)
    implementation(libs.retrofit)
    implementation(libs.converter.gson)
    implementation(libs.play.services.location)


}
